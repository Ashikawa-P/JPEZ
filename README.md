# JPEZ
Tool to simulate determinism in japanese pronounciation for learners

# Determi.. what?!
In japanese many words consist of Kanj. Kanji can have multiple readings. The pronounciation of a given Kanji is indeterministic. Learning japanese means learning a given words specific pronounciation and reading. This projects legacy scope goes as far as simulating determinism by creating pronopunciation oriented filtering options for all japanese words. In practice, learners shall be able to filter out all words in which a Kanji is not pronounced in a user selected way. If one would select one pronounciation per Kanji, all words that result would be deterministic in their pronounciation and thus easing the learning curve.


# legacy Scope

- word length
- Pronoucniation
- words consisting of jouyou-kanji only
